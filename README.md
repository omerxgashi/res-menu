Restaurant Menu Website

This is a simple project where I've created a restaurant menu website using HTML, CSS and a little bit Bootstrap. 
It's a small website that showcases a restaurant's menu. You can see different food and drink items listed with prices, all laid out in a clean and easy-to-read format.

To check out the menu, all you have to do is open the index.html file in your web browser. You'll see the menu displayed right there on your screen.

If you have any criticism, advices or ideas for improving the website or want to add new features, feel free to jump in! Just fork the repository, make your changes, and then send me a pull request.
